## Module 1 Capstone - Vending Machine Software

This is the first capstone completed while at Tech Elevator and it was done as a partner exercise. The purpose was to
demonstrate our understanding of Java fundamentals and their proper implementation. These fundamentals included local
branching, loops, arrays, command-line programs, OOP, unit testing, and File I/O reading. The capstone required us to 
develop an application for a vending machine distributor, that is integrated with everyone's bank accounts. This allows 
customers to purchase products from their computers at their convenience.
